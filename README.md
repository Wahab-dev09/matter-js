/**
 * Matter JS Project
 * 
 * This project demonstrates the use of Matter.js, a 2D physics engine, to create a dynamic,
 * responsive simulation featuring falling balls and overlayed custom text. The application 
 * adjusts based on the viewport size and uses modern React best practices.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Dynamic Ball Simulation:
 *   Balls are generated in varying quantities based on screen size (Mobile, Tablet, or Desktop).
 * 
 * - Responsive Design:
 *   The number of physics objects adjusts to the viewport size using a custom hook, `useResponsiveJSX`.
 * 
 * - Interactive Physics:
 *   Users can interact with the balls using their mouse, thanks to the Matter.js `MouseConstraint`.
 * 
 * - Customizable Aesthetic:
 *   Balls have dynamic colors, and the canvas background is styled to a modern, minimalistic design.
 * 
 * - Overlayed Text:
 *   The canvas renders custom, centered text ("Matter JS" and "Explore the World of Physics!") using 
 *   Matter.js's `afterRender` event.
 * 
 * Files:
 * 1. **MatterBoilerplate.js**:
 *    - Handles the core physics simulation using Matter.js.
 *    - Includes the responsive design logic and renders the falling balls and overlayed text.
 * 
 * 2. **useResponsiveJSX.js**:
 *    - A custom React hook that determines the screen size breakpoint (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
 *    - Used to dynamically adjust the number of physics objects.
